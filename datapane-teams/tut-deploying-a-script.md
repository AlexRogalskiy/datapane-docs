# Introduction

## Overview

Data scientists like using the Python ecosystem to analyze data, but struggle to share results with stakeholders or make analyses self-service. 

Datapane provides an API-first platform enables data teams to share interactive reports and apps with stakeholders and clients. This means data scientists can use the tools they are gifted at to drive business decisions, and stakeholders can self-serve on insights and scripts \(instead of waiting on a backlog\).
