# Introduction

## Overview

Many data teams prefer the flexibility and power of the open-source Python ecosystem, but struggle with the last mile of turning a Python analysis into something which can be shared, automated, and deliver business value. _Datapane for Teams_ provides an API-first platform which enables Python-based reporting inside companies. This means data teams can use the tools they are gifted at to drive business decisions, and  stakeholders can self-serve on what the data team is building, instead of waiting on a backlog.

In addition to providing secure, authenticated report sharing, _Datapane for Teams_ allows automated report generation by allowing data teams to deploy their Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to the cloud. Reports can be generated from parameters entered through web forms, on a schedule, or on-demand through our HTTP and Python APIs.
