# Deploying a Script

## Overview

In the [previous section](tut-creating-a-report.md), we explored building and sharing a report programatically using the Datapane library in your Python script . This tutorial shows you how to run and deploy this script \(or Jupyter Notebook\) via a Datapane hosted instance so that other people can use them to dynamically generate their own reports.

Datapane "scripts" are created by deploying your Python code or Jupyter Notebook using Datapane's CLI. Scripts on Datapane can be shared and run directly from your browser without having to install anything to generate reports on demand or run actions.

You create a script on datapane by deploying your Python code or Jupyter Notebook using Datapane's CLI. Scripts on Datapane are exposed to users through web forms which can be run in the browser to generate reports. This means that people can generate reports without worrying about code, notebooks, or setting up a Python environment. Scripts can take parameters from users which are passed into your Python code at runtime.

## Deploying a script

Any Python code or Jupyter notebooks \(using a Python kernel\) is supported, and you can make full use of the Datapane API to generate reports, run any actions, or return results as needed. 

If you have a local Python script or notebook which creates a report using Datapane's `Report.create` method \(see [Creating a Report](tut-creating-a-report.md)\), you can upload it straight to Datapane using the CLI.

```text
$ datapane script deploy --script=analysis.ipynb
```

Let's take the following code which pulls stock data from Yahoo finance and deploy it using Datapane's CLI. At the bottom, we have a `Report.create` method which constructs our report, which will be returned to the user when they run our script using the Datapane web interface.

{% hint style="info" %}
We recommend creating only one report per script - as many can be created as needed, however only the last one in each script will be tracked in the web interface.
{% endhint %}

{% code title="analysis.ipynb" %}
```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from datapane import Table, Plot, Markdown, Report

tickers = ['GOOG']
dfs = []

for t in tickers:
    t_df = pd.read_csv(f'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/{t}?period1=1553600505&period2=1585222905&interval=1d&events=history')
    t_df['ticker'] = t
    dfs.append(t_df)

stock_data = pd.concat(dfs)
stock_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stock_data['Date'])
stock_data['pct_change'] = stock_data.groupby('ticker')['Close'].pct_change()
stock_data['cum_prod'] = (1 + stock_data['pct_change']).cumprod()

plot = alt.Chart(stock_data).encode(x='Date:T',y='cum_prod', color='ticker').mark_line()

Report.create(
    Markdown("##Â Stock Report"),
    Table.create(stock_data),
    Plot.create(plot)
 )
```
{% endcode %}

To deploy it, use Datapane's CLI.

```bash
$ datapane script deploy --script=analysis.ipynb --name=simple_script
Script created: https://datapane.com/datapane/scripts/simple_script/
```

This makes your script available on [datapane.com](https://datapane.com/) \(or your private instance\).

When a user runs your script, they will be able to generate the report from the previous example dynamically. For this specific report, this isn't particularly helpful yet, as it is similar each time. Next, we will make it dynamic by configuring it with some parameters which users can send into our code.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can run your script from the web, from the command line, or using the API -- for instance through a Github action. This tutorial will focus on running your script through the web interface.
{% endhint %}

## Configuration

## Configuration

In the above example, we are deploying a single notebook and providing configuration through command-line arguments. This works well for simple scripts, but scripts often need other configuration, such as parameters definitions, other files or folders to deploy, and pip requirements.

Datapane allows you to provide a configuration file called `datapane.yaml`. When you `deploy`, Datapane looks for this file automatically. Before we continue, create a project structure with the `script init` command, which creates a sample `datapane.yaml` and a simple script.

Before we continue, create a project structure with the `script init` command, which creates a sample `datapane.yaml` and a simple script.

```bash
 ~/C/d/d/my-new-proj> datapane script init
Created script 'my-new-proj', edit as needed and upload
 ~/C/d/d/my-new-proj> ls
datapane.yaml dp-script.py
```

We already have a script, so we can delete the sample `dp-script.py` and copy in our own notebook or script. Because we're replacing the default script, we should specify this in our `datapane.yaml` using the `script` field. Whilst we're there, we can also add the name of our script.

We already have a script, so we can delete the sample `dp-script.py` and copy in our own notebook. Because we're replacing the default script, we should specify this in our `datapane.yaml` using the `script` field. Whilst we're there, we can also add the name and title for our script.

{% code title="datapane.yaml" %}
```yaml
name: stock_plotter
script: analysis.ipynb
```
{% endcode %}

See the [API reference](../reference/scripts/datapane.yaml.md) for all the available configuration fields.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there is a datapane.yaml, you don't need to provide the path of your analysis when you deploy. Instead, your script lives in `dp_script.py` or `dp_script.ipynb` by default.
{% endhint %}

## Running & Parameters

Input parameters are inputted through a web form and are passed into your code at runtime. These are defined in your `datapane.yaml` and are accessible in the `Params` dictionary inside your script. When we are developing locally, `Params` is empty by default, but you can load in the default parameters from your `datapane.yaml` \(or any other YAML file\) using the following command:

```python
Params.load_defaults('datapane.yaml')
```

In this case, let's allow users to provide the stock tickers they are interested in through a `tickers` parameter. To create an input for our `tickers` parameter on the web interface, we must add it to our `datapane.yaml` .

{% hint style="info" %}
Full details of parameter configuration and available fields are provided in the [API reference](../reference/scripts/datapane.yaml.md#parameters).
{% endhint %}

{% code title="datapane.yaml" %}
```yaml
title: Stock plotter
name: stock_plotter

parameters:
  - name: tickers
    type: list
    default: ['GOOG', 'ZM']
    description: "Tickers to plot"
```
{% endcode %}

We can then access it in our code, and use `load_defaults` to load in the default values from our `datapane.yaml`

```text
import pandas as pd
import datapane as dp
import altair as alt
import yfinance as yf

from scipy.stats import zscore

tickers = ['GOOG']
dfs = []

data = yf.download(tickers=' '.join(tickers), period=period, groupby='ticker').Close

for ticker in tickers:
    data[ticker] = zscore(data[ticker])

df = data.reset_index().melt('Date', var_name='symbol', value_name='price')

base_chart = alt.Chart(df).encode(x='Date:T', y='price:Q', color='symbol').interactive()

chart = base_chart.mark_line() if plot_type == 'line' else base_chart.mark_bar()

dp.Report.create(dp.Plot.create(chart), dp.Table.create(df))
```

{% code title="analysis.ipynb" %}
```python
import pandas as pd
import altair as alt
from datapane import Table, Plot, Markdown, Params

# tickers = ['GOOG']
Params.load_defaults('datapane.yaml')
tickers = Params.get('tickers')

dfs = []

for t in tickers:
    t_df = pd.read_csv(f'https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v7/finance/download/{t}?period1=1553600505&period2=1585222905&interval=1d&events=history')
    t_df['ticker'] = t
    dfs.append(t_df)

stock_data = pd.concat(dfs)
stock_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(stock_data['Date'])
stock_data['pct_change'] = stock_data.groupby('ticker')['Close'].pct_change()
stock_data['cum_prod'] = (1 + stock_data['pct_change']).cumprod()

plot = alt.Chart(stock_data).encode(x='Date:T',y='cum_prod', color='ticker').mark_line()

Report.create(
  Markdown("## Stock Report"),
  Table.create(stock_data),
  Plot.create(plot)
)
```
{% endcode %}

When we run `script deploy`, Datapane will use configuration to generate the following form.

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%286%29.png)

Users can now enter various stocks which they would like to plot, and receive a dynamic report each time.

#### Including additional files and folders

## Dependencies and Requirements

Your Python script or notebook may have requirements on external libraries. Datapane supports both the ability to add local folders and files, which you can deploy alongside your script, and the ability to include `pip` requirements, which are made available to your script when it is run on Datapane. These are both configured in your `datapane.yaml`.

### Including pip dependencies

In the above example, we may want to use the [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library in Python, instead of manually reading a CSV from Yahoo. To do this, we can add it to a `requirements` list in our `datapane.yaml`

{% code title="datapane.yaml" %}
```yaml
title: Stock plotter
name: stock_plotter

parameters:
  - name: tickers
    type: list
    default: ['GOOG', 'ZM']
    description: "Tickers to plot"

requirements:
  - yfinance
```
{% endcode %}

### Including additional files and folders

Additionally, we may want to include a local Python folder or file. Imagine we have a separate Python file, `stock_scaler.py` which helps us scale the values of our stocks, and which we want to use in our notebook.

```text
~/C/d/d/my-new-proj> ls
dp-script.ipynb datapane.yaml stock_scaler.py
```

To include this in the deploy, we can add it to `include` .

{% code title="datapane.yaml" %}
```yaml
name: stock_plotter

script: analysis.ipynb

requirements:
  - yfinance

include:
  - stock_scaler.py
```
{% endcode %}
