# Export to Medium

Write a lot on Medium? Datapane lets you convert your existing Datapane reports into Medium story drafts, preserving formatting and layout while making all visualizations interactive. 

The text blocks in your report are converted to text in your Medium story, and all plots, datasets, and files are automatically embedded.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you just need to embed a public report or plot directly into a Medium article, see the section on [embedding](https://docs.datapane.com/reports/embedding-reports-in-social-platforms). This section is for converting Datapane reports into Medium drafts.

### **3. Share Report**

When you navigate to an existing report and click 'Share Report', you'll now see an option to 'Create Medium Story'. Clicking on this will export the contents of your existing report to Medium as a draft \(just make sure that your report visibility is set to 'Public'\). You can edit the content further and publish on Medium once you're ready.
