# Embedding Reports in Social Platforms

## Overview

When you publish a report to https://datapane.com, you can embed it into other platforms.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before embedding, make sure your report's visibility is set to public.  Also make sure to have just one graph or table in the URL
{% endhint %}

## Integrations

### Medium

[Example ](https://medium.com/@leo_26134/embedding-with-datapane-366e60434b5f)

To embed a report on Medium, publish it to Datapane, and copy and paste the full URL of your report into your Medium editor. Medium will automatically create the embed, and you will see the following. In edit mode, your embed will not be interactive - you must publish the post first to use interactive elements.

### Reddit

[Example](https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/h7nspg/oc_when_the_bookies_were_wrong_premier_league/)

To embed a report into reddit, create a post with your report's URL. If your report does not appear inline at first, click the **Retry Thumb** button to prompt Reddit to reload it.

In the post view, your report will be able to be used interactively.
