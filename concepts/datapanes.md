# Boards

## Creating Boards

Boards can be built using either Datapane's Python API, CLI, and the Web UI on [datapane.com](https://datapane.com). Boards are comprised of blocks of Datasets, Assets \(such as files, visualisations, and plots\), and Text.

| Block Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Datasets](datasets.md) | Resources of tabular data that can be added to your boards. [Learn More](datasets.md) |
| [Assets](visualisations.md) | Results from your analysis, such as visualisations and files. Learn More |
| Text | A markdown block which you can use to document and annotate your board |

## Previewing

Boards have two modes, **Edit** and **View**. If you are the owner of the Datapane you will see the Datapane in edit mode by default. Toggling the **Preview** button will switch to view mode, showing you how your board appears to others.

## Sharing

Boards can be shared with others by sending them the URL. 

By default, boards and only visible by yourself. You can change the visibility to public by switching the **Public/Private Toggle** in Edit Mode.

## Embedding

Boards can be embedded onto other platforms, such as your internal wiki, a web page, or social medium platforms such as Reddit and Medium.
